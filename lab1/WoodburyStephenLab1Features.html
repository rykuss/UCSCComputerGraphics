    <p>Assignment Details: To Draw a Poly-Line using a series of left click mouse positions.
                    A Right click will end the drawing of a Poly-Line.
                    If the Polyline is not yet complete and there is at least one
                    known vertex of the polyline, there will be a line drawn between 
                    your mouse cursor and the last entered vertex of the poly line
                    A vertex is entered into the polyline when the left mouse button
                    is clicked. </p>
    <p>Additional Features: The program functions as specified. No additional features </p>
    <p>Notes: I added functions: screenRefresh, calculateWEBGLXCoordinate, and calculateWEBGLYCoordinate
       For efficiency and for easier reading. They'll be listed under Helper Functions in WoodburyStephenLab1Driver.js</p>
