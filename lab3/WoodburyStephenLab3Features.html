    <p>Name: Stephen Woodbury</p>
    <p>Student ID: 1429496 : swoodbur</p>
    <p>Submission For: Lab3 </p>
    <p>Date: 11/5/2017 </p>
    <p>Files Included: WoodburyStephenLab3Features.html, WoodburyStephenLab3Driver.html, WoodburyStephenLab3Driver.js, WoodburyStephenLab3Output.jpg </p>
    <p>Assignment Details: Take Prog2, add a second light source to the scene, enable light source picking and perspective changing</p>
    <p>Additional Features: None</p>
    <p>Notes: I had troubles with this lab, I need to modularize my code for scalability. That being said, I've gotten everything but perspective changing to 
       perform as specified. Ie, I've succeeded in adding two light sources, light picking, and dimensions changing. I just didn't succeed in changing to perspective
       viewing. I tried working with the functions given, I couldn't get anything to show on the screen</p>
