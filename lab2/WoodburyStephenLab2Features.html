    <p>Assignment Details: To give our Cylinders from prog1 color and shading </p>
    <p>Additional Features: There are no additional features</p>
    <p>Notes: This is not complete. Saving and Loading objects is not fully functional
              Coloring of my generalized cylinder is not perfect and needs some work
              I didn't touch projection at all and was rather confused as to what we were
              supposed to do about it and how to implement it. I also didn't get the normal toggle button to work
              For coloring, I multiplied the magnitude of the color
              by a factor of 2 to make it more noticeable. Additionally, the code is messy and a work
              in progress. It will be cleaned up by next assignment, and the kinks will be worked out</p>
