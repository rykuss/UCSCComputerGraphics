# UCSCComputerGraphics
All of My work from "CMPS 160: Computer Graphics", an advanced introductory class to Computer Graphics using webgl.

There is a lib folder that contains necessary libraries for various projects in this repo. It was given to us by our TA and allowed for
better data manipulation and for more complex projects. 

There are also 4 labs and 4 programs but they follow the same submission format. For any sub repo you open, check out the features file 
for a basic HTML page which a basic description of the program. There is a link inside that features file that links you to the html driver of the project.
