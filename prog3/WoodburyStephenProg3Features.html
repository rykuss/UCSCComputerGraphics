    <p>Notes: Modularizing my code took time. I did as much as I could in the time limit. I finished just about everything. The only things that doesn't
       Perform as specified is rotation. It rotates just fine, but the lighting doesn't change. I need to fix that. I also need to clean up my code to
       Make things more efficient. Please don't dock me too hard on rotation stuff for the grade. I have been working on this nonstop since thursday and
       Have even skipped classes to work on this. This took so much time because I didn't utilize cuon matrix functions as well as I should have and I
       had to rewrite the program from the ground up for modularzing. Thanks!</p>
