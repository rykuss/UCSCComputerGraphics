    <p>Name: Stephen Woodbury</p>
    <p>Student ID: 1429496 : swoodbur</p>
    <p>Submission For: Prog1 </p>
    <p> Date: 10/15/2017 </p>
    <p> Files Included: WoodburyStephenProg1Features.html, WoodburyStephenProg1Driver.html, WoodburyStephenProg1Driver.js, WoodburyStephenProg1Output.jpg </p>
    <p>Assignment Details: To generate a spine, which is like generating a polyline in lab1.
       Once done with the spine, generate a cylinder. </p>
    <p>Additional Features: The program functions as specified. There are no disjoint cylinder 
       junctions. There is a basic prototype version of generation of normals. It is not fully
       tested or implemented so consider normal generation a work in progress. If you'd like to 
       see the prototype, uncomment line 389 of WoodburyStephenProg1Driver.js. Normal generation
       is disabled by default.</p>
    <p>Notes: I added several helper functions under Helper Functions in 
       WoodburyStephenProg1Driver.js . The functions you should not consider for grading  
       are: generateNormal and enableNormals. These functions are related to generating normal
       vectors and are still under development. IMPORTANT: I'm assuming the graders will have a copy
       of ioSOR.js in directory, the local directory. There were no instructions otherwise on if
       we need to turn in a version of ioSOR.js or if it was a file located where lib is. So
       I assumed it was in the local directory with the Driver files.</p>
